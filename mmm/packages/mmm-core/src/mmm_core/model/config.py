"""Model configuration: how a channel enters the model, and its prior expectations.

This is exactly the surface Claude *parameterizes* per client — which channel is
intent-driven vs. brand-building, how long its carry-over is expected to last, which
carry-over/saturation shape to use, which likelihood fits the KPI, and how tight each
prior should be — without ever rewriting the model maths itself. Every default here
reproduces the original single-shape (geometric + Hill + Normal) model, so existing
configs keep fitting identically; the new fields only *widen* the toolbox.
